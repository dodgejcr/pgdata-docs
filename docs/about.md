The goal of this project is provide data that is provided in real-time, or close to real-time, from the nation's ISO/RTOs in one centralized location and format.

This site has been developed without the use of large web infrastructres such as Amazon Web Service and Google Cloud Platform. The aim was to keep this as contained to one machine in order to keep costs low, maintenance easy, and be able to teach others how to work with data in an administrative environment. All software used for this server is Open Source by design and most fall under the GPL, BSD, or MIT licenses.
